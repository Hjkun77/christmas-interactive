      <p class="content">
        Situated in the basement right below an escalator of a mall near
        Marikina City, Arthur Leynes (right in photo) waits for a potential customer that might
        come his way. The interior of his booth is lined with different
        sketches in various mediums. Inside the store is another artist,
        sketching on a canvas. Verpan Artnook is the name of the small shop
        that Leynes owns together with his partner, Elver Panuela.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Leynes works as an artist in his day-to-day job. Prior to this, he
        taught philosophy and humanities in Adamson University. Panuela, on
        the other hand, studied illustration in college, with a degree in fine
        arts from University of the East Caloocan. Their work mainly consists
        of taking orders from customers and selling their art at varying price
        points depending on the size and the medium used. They begin
        operations at 10:00 AM and end at 9:00 PM every day--7:00 PM on
        Christmas--as per mall schedule.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Verpan Artnook stays open even on the 25th of December. <em>“Basta opening
          [ng]</em> mall, <em>‘yan nagtatrabaho na kami</em> (For as long as the mall is open,
        we work),” he says.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        In fact, work is especially hectic for Leynes and his partner during
        the holidays as there is a remarkable 95% increase in orders from
        customers, especially during Christmas. <em>“Dumadami yung nagpapagawa
          kasi siyempre, pinangreregalo nila yun eh</em> (The customers increase
        because they give the art as gifts),” he explains.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        To Leynes, working during Christmas time is nothing out of the
        ordinary. <em> “Kapag nandun ka sa posisyon, andun ka sa trabaho, magiging
          normal na lang yun eh</em> (If you are in that position and are there at
        work, then it becomes normal),” he says.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Although Christmas is a holiday, Leynes and Panuela happily work to
        finish the sketches ordered in time for their due dates, considering
        that their art takes about a week or two to finish. <em>“Hindi pwedeng
          hindi mo gawin. Kasi</em> once <em>na balikan nila yun...hindi mo nagawa</em>,
        that’s another problem (You cannot not do it. Because once they come
        back for it...and you did not get to finish it, that’s another
        problem).”
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        We see this attitude in his mindset about the holidays as well. For
        instance, when it comes to Christmas as a whole, Leynes chooses not to
        view the celebration through a religious point of view. According to
        Leynes, doing so would inevitably lead to the thought that he has to
        rest during a special holiday. Instead, he chooses to simply consider
        Christmas as another day of work, reminding himself that they are
        “[bound] by the rules and regulations [of] the mall.”
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        In the end, Leynes states that, ultimately, to be working during
        Christmastime is a mere answer to a call of duty. <em>
          “Kailangan mong
          itanggi yung sarili mo.
        </em> (You have to deny yourself),” he says. “You
        have no choice but to do your part in your task.”

    </div>
    <div class="content-container">
      <p class="content">
        In the highly-urbanized Ortigas City, it’s easy to get caught up in
        the fast-paced environment of a city where every move counts for your
        paycheck. Just a couple of kilometers away from the hustle and bustle
        is Parang, Marikina, where you’ll meet 27-year-old and father of two
        Lunar Victor who frequents the Ortigas area as a cargo analyst in a
        business process outsourcing (BPO) company. His job entails monitoring
        the logistics of the company’s shipping services by determining
        cost-effective ways to complete shipments.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Coming from humble beginnings, Victor began working in the industry to
        fulfill his financial needs. Through a close friend, he was able to
        apply at the company he’s currently working in after going through
        multiple jobs. Victor was no stranger to the various ups and downs of
        job-hunting, but after gauging salaries and work environments, he
        eventually found the perfect fit for him in Silver City, a
        teleperformance business service.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        As is expected of anyone in a BPO company, Victor has experienced his
        fair share of graveyard shifts and work on the holidays. <em>
          “Para sa
          ‘kin, pang-alipin talaga ang dating
        </em> [<em>ng</em> graveyard shifts <em>
          at pagtrabaho
          tuwing Pasko
        </em>]. Same <em>lang ‘yung</em> routine <em>mo araw-araw</em>. <em>
          Nakakaurat [at]
          nakakalungkot [ito], kasi paulit-ulit lang ‘yung buhay mo
        </em>,” he says.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        (For me, you will feel like a slave during graveyard shifts and
        working during Christmas. The routine is the same. It’s tiring and
        saddening, because everything in your life is repetitive.)
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Working in the BPO industry comes with a plethora of caveats, but for
        Victor, dealing with frustrated customers is one of his biggest
        struggles. “<em>Marami [akong nakakasalamuha na iba’t ibang customers]</em>
        <em>lalo na sa</em> account <em>ko ngayon</em>. <em>
          Mga matatanda na. Sobrang gagalitin
          nila. Talagang ‘pag tumawag pa lang, galit na galit na. Hindi mo
          mako
        </em>-control [<em>‘yung mga ganong sitwasyon</em>] <em>eh</em>,” he laments.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        (I encounter a variety of customers, especially in my account now.
        They’re old and often temperamental. Some of them are already angry
        when they call you. But you can’t control that kind of situation.)
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Despite these instances, Victor draws strength from many things. Being
        a young father of two, his family is his greatest inspiration.
        Financial insecurity does not change the fact that he is constantly
        motivated by his wife and children. Rather, he is only pushed to work
        harder for the sake of their futures: <em>
          “Syempre iba ‘yung pamilya na
          bini
        </em>-build <em>namin. Kailangan magsikap din kami para sa sarili namin</em> (Of
        course, we want to build our family. We have to persevere for our own
        sake.)”
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        For those who try their luck at establishing careers at the heart of
        Metro Manila, burn out and exhaustion in one’s work becomes an all too
        familiar experience. However, Victor still finds a way to relax even
        when the going gets tough. In fact, he finds solace in dancing. <em>
          "Iba
          rin ‘yung
        </em> joy <em>
          ng pagsasayaw...‘Pag pagod ka na magtrabaho, kailangan
          mo ng
        </em> stress reliever. <em>[Pagsasayaw] ‘yung</em> stress reliever
        <em>
          ko...Nagtuloy lang ako nang nagtuloy ng trabaho, hanggang sa sinipagan
          ko nang sinipagan, pero hindi pa rin ako tumigil sa pagsasayaw,”
        </em> he says.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        (The joy dancing gives is different...When you’re tired of working,
        you need a stress reliever. For me, dancing is my stress reliever...I
        just continued to persevere in my work, but I never stopped dancing.)
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Victor admits he always finds time to dance. It’s not only therapeutic
        for him after the long work week is over, but it’s also his way of
        giving back to the community where he lives. Oftentimes, Victor can be
        found teaching some of the neighborhood children of Marikina how to
        dance along to the latest beats on the radio. While this may initially
        look like something that’s all fun and games, Victor shares that he
        teaches dance to help children that he feels are going down a wrong
        path. The situation is all too familiar for him, and dance was one of
        the few things that got him through his struggles.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        <em>“Ayaw ko nang mangyari sa kanila [‘yung nangyari sa akin dati]</em> (I
        don’t want them to experience what happened with me before),” he
        divulges, sharing that he got involved with the wrong crowd in his
        childhood. <em>
          “‘Yun yung naging insipirasyon ko. ‘Yun nalang ‘yung naging
          bisyo ko, [ang] pagsasayaw
        </em> (That became my inspiration. That became my
        only vice: Dancing.)”
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        At the end of the day, Victor knows he should dance to the realities
        of life. After every obstacle he’s overcome from working all kinds of
        holiday shifts, it’s the only way to get through every day: <em>
          “Hindi
          ganon karangya ang buhay namin. Syempre, may
        </em> bills <em>
          kami na kailangang
          bayaran
        </em>...Thankful <em>
          pa rin ako kasi may trabaho ako [at] di ako
          nahihirapan
        </em> (We don’t have well-off lives. Of course, there are bills
        we have to pay...I’m still thankful that I have a job and it’s not
        hard for me.)”
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Playing your cards right becomes part of surviving daily life, and
        Victor believes that the worst possible thing would be to not have any
        work at all. To him, any kind of work during the holidays is just one
        of the many sacrifices people have to make to get through each day.
        <em>
          “Walang madaling trabaho sa totoo lang. Kailangan mo lang yakapin ang
          realidad. ‘Yun [ang] buhay eh. Kailangan mong magsagwan, kasi ‘pag di
          ka nagsagwan, hindi ka uusad
        </em> (There’s no easy job, honestly. You just
        have to accept reality. That’s life. You need to keep rowing the boat,
        because if you don’t, you won’t move forward,)” he says.

    <div class="content-container">
      <p class="content">
        There is not a tenant in My Place Residence Halls, Katipunan, who
        hasn’t encountered Alexander Seargent, fondly known by the dormers as
        Kuya Alex. While the technicalities of his job as Employee and Tenants
        Relations Officer mostly has him checking e-mails and streamlining
        operations, Seargent has also developed good relations with most of My
        Place’s occupants with his warm disposition and approachable
        temperament.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        After six years of working at My Place, Seargent has seen a lot of
        residents come and go. To sit down and talk to them is more than just
        his occupation; he mentions that he considers the tenants as his own
        children--a sentiment that motivates him to take on holiday shifts.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        The main reason why Seargent has had to be on duty during the holidays
        is because of My Place’s nature as a workplace. He mentions how My
        Place is part of a Filipino-owned chain of accommodations that are
        expected to run 24/7. “<em>Maski</em> holiday, <em>may mga tao pa rin dito</em> that
        need to be taken care of (Even though it’s a holiday, there are still
        people here that need to be taken care of),” Seargent shares.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Despite their commitment to caring for homeway students, Seargent and
        MyPlace's Christmas employee crew are far from tireless and
        invincible. As the familiar fatigue from a long day creeps in,
        Seargent blasts his favorite hits or scrolls through YouTube for
        random videos to keep the exhaustion at bay. These little joys are
        essential for Seargent’s morale, which quickly diminishes during the
        holiday season with only two other workers in the building to share in
        numerous responsibilites. The grand total of three employees
        unsurprisingly leads to more instances of overtime--but Seargent knows
        his limits and guarantees that he has never felt like the additional
        hours were too much for his well-being.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        However, Seargent's optimistic disposition does not cancel out his
        longing to spend the holidays at home, surrounded by his loved ones.
        Seargent's sentiments further highlight the precarious balance that
        many Christmas workers have to manage to make ends meet: <em>“May</em> side <em>
          na,
          syempre, malungkot kasi syempre
        </em> you want to spend time with family
        (There’s a side that’s obviously sad because you definitely want to
        spend time with family),” he says. “<em>
          [Pero] medyo masaya nang kaunti
          kasi
        </em> it’s double pay (It’s a bit happy because it’s double pay).”
        However, no amount of money can compensate for the warmth of spending
        the holidays with family. “<em>Minsan na nga lang magka</em>-holiday (Holidays
        don’t come every day),” Seargent laments.
      </p>
      <p class="content">
        Another blessing Seargent is grateful for is his MyPlace Christmas
        crew--a group that has mastered the art of compromise amid necessity.
        Seargent shares that there have been some Christmases in which he got
        to spend it in his actual home thanks to the flexibility of his
        teammates; in turn, he gladly clocks in on New Year’s day to return
        the favor. “It’s a sacrifice we’re happy to make,” Seargent says,
        talking about his co-workers and the many other teams of the
        dormitory—the security, the concierge, and the housekeepers.

        One might wonder how the festive spirit still manages to survive in
        conditions so far away from home, but Seargent assures that they still
        “make ways to celebrate.” In fact, one Christmas, he had gone out in
        the middle of the night to buy some microwavable meals from 7/11, only
        to end up inviting the people behind the counter to dinner. They
        obliged, and Seargent’s makeshift Noche Buena with My Place’s guard
        and housekeeper, and 7/11’s cashiers was suddenly in full swing.

        At the end of the day, Seargent has only one wish for those who avail
        of their services on the holidays: Compassion. “Wish <em>ko lang na sana</em>
        they empathize (I just wish they could empathize),” he says, noting
        that customers in hotels can be demanding at times. “<em>Sana</em> they
        understand na it’s still a holiday for us, too.”

        “Spread love, lalo na sa mga naka-duty (Spread love, even more to
        those on duty),” Seargent concludes.
