        <h1>In the name of art and mall hours</h1>
        <p class="author">by Keziah Maru Z. Pasion</p>

          SITUATED IN the basement right below an escalator of a mall near
          Marikina City, Arthur Leynes waits for a potential customer that might
          come his way. The interior of his booth is lined with different
          sketches in various mediums. Inside the store is another artist,
          sketching on a canvas. Verpan Artnook is the name of the small shop
          that Leynes owns together with his partner, Elver Panuela.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Leynes works as an artist in his day-to-day job. Prior to this, he
          taught philosophy and humanities in Adamson University. Panuela, on
          the other hand, studied illustration in college, with a degree in fine
          arts from University of the East Caloocan. Their work mainly consists
          of taking orders from customers and selling their art at varying price
          points depending on the size and the medium used. They begin
          operations at 10:00 AM and end at 9:00 PM every day--7:00 PM on
          Christmas--as per mall schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Verpan Artnook stays open even on the 25th of December. “Basta opening
          [ng] mall, ‘yan nagtatrabaho na kami (For as long as the mall is open,
          we work),” he says.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          In fact, work is especially hectic for Leynes and his partner during
          the holidays as there is a remarkable 95% increase in orders from
          customers, especially during Christmas. “Dumadami yung nagpapagawa
          kasi siyempre, pinangreregalo nila yun eh (The customers increase
          because they give the art as gifts),” he explains.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          To Leynes, working during Christmas time is nothing out of the
          ordinary. “Kapag nandun ka sa posisyon, andun ka sa trabaho, magiging
          normal na lang yun eh (If you are in that position and are there at
          work, then it becomes normal),” he says.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Although Christmas is a holiday, Leynes and Panuela happily work to
          finish the sketches ordered in time for their due dates, considering
          that their art takes about a week or two to finish. “Hindi pwedeng
          hindi mo gawin. Kasi once na balikan nila yun...hindi mo nagawa,
          that’s another problem (You cannot not do it. Because once they come
          back for it...and you did not get to finish it, that’s another
          problem).”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          We see this attitude in his mindset about the holidays as well. For
          instance, when it comes to Christmas as a whole, Leynes chooses not to
          view the celebration through a religious point of view. According to
          Leynes, doing so would inevitably lead to the thought that he has to
          rest during a special holiday. Instead, he chooses to simply consider
          Christmas as another day of work, reminding himself that they are
          “[bound] by the rules and regulations [of] the mall.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          In the end, Leynes states that, ultimately, to be working during
          Christmastime is a mere answer to a call of duty. “Kailangan mong
          itanggi yung sarili mo. (You have to deny yourself),” he says. “You
          have no choice but to do your part in your task.”
