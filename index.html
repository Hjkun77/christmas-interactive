        <h1>In the name of art and mall hours</h1>

        <p class="content">
          SITUATED IN the basement right below an escalator of a mall near
          Marikina City, Arthur Leynes waits for a potential customer that might
          come his way. The interior of his booth is lined with different
          sketches in various mediums. Inside the store is another artist,
          sketching on a canvas. Verpan Artnook is the name of the small shop
          that Leynes owns together with his partner, Elver Panuela.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Leynes works as an artist in his day-to-day job. Prior to this, he
          taught philosophy and humanities in Adamson University. Panuela, on
          the other hand, studied illustration in college, with a degree in fine
          arts from University of the East Caloocan. Their work mainly consists
          of taking orders from customers and selling their art at varying price
          points depending on the size and the medium used. They begin
          operations at 10:00 AM and end at 9:00 PM every day--7:00 PM on
          Christmas--as per mall schedule.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Verpan Artnook stays open even on the 25th of December. “Basta opening
          [ng] mall, ‘yan nagtatrabaho na kami (For as long as the mall is open,
          we work),” he says.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          In fact, work is especially hectic for Leynes and his partner during
          the holidays as there is a remarkable 95% increase in orders from
          customers, especially during Christmas. “Dumadami yung nagpapagawa
          kasi siyempre, pinangreregalo nila yun eh (The customers increase
          because they give the art as gifts),” he explains.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          To Leynes, working during Christmas time is nothing out of the
          ordinary. “Kapag nandun ka sa posisyon, andun ka sa trabaho, magiging
          normal na lang yun eh (If you are in that position and are there at
          work, then it becomes normal),” he says.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Although Christmas is a holiday, Leynes and Panuela happily work to
          finish the sketches ordered in time for their due dates, considering
          that their art takes about a week or two to finish. “Hindi pwedeng
          hindi mo gawin. Kasi once na balikan nila yun...hindi mo nagawa,
          that’s another problem (You cannot not do it. Because once they come
          back for it...and you did not get to finish it, that’s another
          problem).”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          We see this attitude in his mindset about the holidays as well. For
          instance, when it comes to Christmas as a whole, Leynes chooses not to
          view the celebration through a religious point of view. According to
          Leynes, doing so would inevitably lead to the thought that he has to
          rest during a special holiday. Instead, he chooses to simply consider
          Christmas as another day of work, reminding himself that they are
          “[bound] by the rules and regulations [of] the mall.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          In the end, Leynes states that, ultimately, to be working during
          Christmastime is a mere answer to a call of duty. “Kailangan mong
          itanggi yung sarili mo. (You have to deny yourself),” he says. “You
          have no choice but to do your part in your task.”

        <h1>Dancing to the rhythm of life</h1>

      </div>
      <div class="content-container">
        <p class="content">
          In the highly-urbanized Ortigas City, it’s easy to get caught up in
          the fast-paced environment of a city where every move counts for your
          paycheck. Just a couple of kilometers away from the hustle and bustle
          is Parang, Marikina, where you’ll meet 27-year-old and father of two
          Lunar Victor who frequents the Ortigas area as a cargo analyst in a
          business process outsourcing (BPO) company. His job entails monitoring
          the logistics of the company’s shipping services by determining
          cost-effective ways to complete shipments.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Coming from humble beginnings, Victor began working in the industry to
          fulfill his financial needs. Through a close friend, he was able to
          apply at the company he’s currently working in after going through
          multiple jobs. Victor was no stranger to the various ups and downs of
          job-hunting, but after gauging salaries and work environments, he
          eventually found the perfect fit for him in Silver City, a
          teleperformance business service.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          As is expected of anyone in a BPO company, Victor has experienced his
          fair share of graveyard shifts and work on the holidays. “Para sa
          ‘kin, pang-alipin talaga ang dating [ng graveyard shifts at pagtrabaho
          tuwing Pasko]. Same lang ‘yung routine mo araw-araw. Nakakaurat [at]
          nakakalungkot [ito], kasi paulit-ulit lang ‘yung buhay mo,” he says.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          (For me, you will feel like a slave during graveyard shifts and
          working during Christmas. The routine is the same. It’s tiring and
          saddening, because everything in your life is repetitive.)
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Working in the BPO industry comes with a plethora of caveats, but for
          Victor, dealing with frustrated customers is one of his biggest
          struggles. “Marami [akong nakakasalamuha na iba’t ibang customers]
          lalo na sa account ko ngayon. Mga matatanda na. Sobrang gagalitin
          nila. Talagang ‘pag tumawag pa lang, galit na galit na. Hindi mo
          mako-control [‘yung mga ganong sitwasyon] eh,” he laments.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          (I encounter a variety of customers, especially in my account now.
          They’re old and often temperamental. Some of them are already angry
          when they call you. But you can’t control that kind of situation.)
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Despite these instances, Victor draws strength from many things. Being
          a young father of two, his family is his greatest inspiration.
          Financial insecurity does not change the fact that he is constantly
          motivated by his wife and children. Rather, he is only pushed to work
          harder for the sake of their futures: “Syempre iba ‘yung pamilya na
          bini-build namin. Kailangan magsikap din kami para sa sarili namin (Of
          course, we want to build our family. We have to persevere for our own
          sake.)”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          For those who try their luck at establishing careers at the heart of
          Metro Manila, burn out and exhaustion in one’s work becomes an all too
          familiar experience. However, Victor still finds a way to relax even
          when the going gets tough. In fact, he finds solace in dancing. “Iba
          rin ‘yung joy ng pagsasayaw...‘Pag pagod ka na magtrabaho, kailangan
          mo ng stress reliever. [Pagsasayaw] ‘yung stress reliever
          ko...Nagtuloy lang ako nang nagtuloy ng trabaho, hanggang sa sinipagan
          ko nang sinipagan, pero hindi pa rin ako tumigil sa pagsasayaw,” he
          says.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          (The joy dancing gives is different...When you’re tired of working,
          you need a stress reliever. For me, dancing is my stress reliever...I
          just continued to persevere in my work, but I never stopped dancing.)
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Victor admits he always finds time to dance. It’s not only therapeutic
          for him after the long work week is over, but it’s also his way of
          giving back to the community where he lives. Oftentimes, Victor can be
          found teaching some of the neighborhood children of Marikina how to
          dance along to the latest beats on the radio. While this may initially
          look like something that’s all fun and games, Victor shares that he
          teaches dance to help children that he feels are going down a wrong
          path. The situation is all too familiar for him, and dance was one of
          the few things that got him through his struggles.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          “Ayaw ko nang mangyari sa kanila [‘yung nangyari sa akin dati] (I
          don’t want them to experience what happened with me before),” he
          divulges, sharing that he got involved with the wrong crowd in his
          childhood. “‘Yun yung naging insipirasyon ko. ‘Yun nalang ‘yung naging
          bisyo ko, [ang] pagsasayaw (That became my inspiration. That became my
          only vice: Dancing.)”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          At the end of the day, Victor knows he should dance to the realities
          of life. After every obstacle he’s overcome from working all kinds of
          holiday shifts, it’s the only way to get through every day: “Hindi
          ganon karangya ang buhay namin. Syempre, may bills kami na kailangang
          bayaran...Thankful pa rin ako kasi may trabaho ako [at] di ako
          nahihirapan (We don’t have well-off lives. Of course, there are bills
          we have to pay...I’m still thankful that I have a job and it’s not
          hard for me.)”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Playing your cards right becomes part of surviving daily life, and
          Victor believes that the worst possible thing would be to not have any
          work at all. To him, any kind of work during the holidays is just one
          of the many sacrifices people have to make to get through each day.
          “Walang madaling trabaho sa totoo lang. Kailangan mo lang yakapin ang
          realidad. ‘Yun [ang] buhay eh. Kailangan mong magsagwan, kasi ‘pag di
          ka nagsagwan, hindi ka uusad (There’s no easy job, honestly. You just
          have to accept reality. That’s life. You need to keep rowing the boat,
          because if you don’t, you won’t move forward,)” he says.

      <div class="content-container">
        <p class="content">
          There is not a tenant in My Place Residence Halls, Katipunan, who
          hasn’t encountered Alexander Seargent, fondly known by the dormers as
          Kuya Alex. While the technicalities of his job as Employee and Tenants
          Relations Officer mostly has him checking e-mails and streamlining
          operations, Seargent has also developed good relations with most of My
          Place’s occupants with his warm disposition and approachable
          temperament.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          After six years of working at My Place, Seargent has seen a lot of
          residents come and go. To sit down and talk to them is more than just
          his occupation; he mentions that he considers the tenants as his own
          children--a sentiment that motivates him to take on holiday shifts.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          The main reason why Seargent has had to be on duty during the holidays
          is because of My Place’s nature as a workplace. He mentions how My
          Place is part of a Filipino-owned chain of accommodations that are
          expected to run 24/7. “Maski holiday, may mga tao pa rin dito that
          need to be taken care of (Even though it’s a holiday, there are still
          people here that need to be taken care of),” Seargent shares.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Despite their commitment to caring for homeway students, Seargent and
          MyPlace's Christmas employee crew are far from tireless and
          invincible. As the familiar fatigue from a long day creeps in,
          Seargent blasts his favorite hits or scrolls through YouTube for
          random videos to keep the exhaustion at bay. These little joys are
          essential for Seargent’s morale, which quickly diminishes during the
          holiday season with only two other workers in the building to share in
          numerous responsibilites. The grand total of three employees
          unsurprisingly leads to more instances of overtime--but Seargent knows
          his limits and guarantees that he has never felt like the additional
          hours were too much for his well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          However, Seargent's optimistic disposition does not cancel out his
          longing to spend the holidays at home, surrounded by his loved ones.
          Seargent's sentiments further highlight the precarious balance that
          many Christmas workers have to manage to make ends meet: “May side na,
          syempre, malungkot kasi syempre you want to spend time with family
          (There’s a side that’s obviously sad because you definitely want to
          spend time with family),” he says. “[Pero] medyo masaya nang kaunti
          kasi it’s double pay (It’s a bit happy because it’s double pay).”
          However, no amount of money can compensate for the warmth of spending
          the holidays with family. “Minsan na nga lang magka-holiday (Holidays
          don’t come every day),” Seargent laments.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          Another blessing Seargent is grateful for is his MyPlace Christmas
          crew--a group that has mastered the art of compromise amid necessity.
          Seargent shares that there have been some Christmases in which he got
          to spend it in his actual home thanks to the flexibility of his
          teammates; in turn, he gladly clocks in on New Year’s day to return
          the favor. “It’s a sacrifice we’re happy to make,” Seargent says,
          talking about his co-workers and the many other teams of the
          dormitory—the security, the concierge, and the housekeepers.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          One might wonder how the festive spirit still manages to survive in
          conditions so far away from home, but Seargent assures that they still
          “make ways to celebrate.” In fact, one Christmas, he had gone out in
          the middle of the night to buy some microwavable meals from 7/11, only
          to end up inviting the people behind the counter to dinner. They
          obliged, and Seargent’s makeshift Noche Buena with My Place’s guard
          and housekeeper, and 7/11’s cashiers was suddenly in full swing.
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          At the end of the day, Seargent has only one wish for those who avail
          of their services on the holidays: Compassion. “Wish ko lang na sana
          they empathize (I just wish they could empathize),” he says, noting
          that customers in hotels can be demanding at times. “Sana they
          understand na it’s still a holiday for us, too.”
        </p>
        <p class="content">
          “Spread love, lalo na sa mga naka-duty (Spread love, even more to
          those on duty),” Seargent concludes.
